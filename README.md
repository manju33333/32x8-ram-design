# 32x8 RAM Design using Verilog

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **32x8 Random Access Memory (RAM)** using **Verilog HDL**.  
The design supports **read** and **write operations** and is implemented using behavioral modeling.

## 🛠️ Features
- 32 memory locations, each storing 8-bit data  
- Write operation with enable signal  
- Read operation with output data bus  
- Clear/Reset functionality  
- Testbench for verifying functionality
